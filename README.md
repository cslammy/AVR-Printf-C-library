# AVR-Printf-C-library
Use this for embedded C on AVR328; sends printf() data to a serial port, equivalent of serial.begin() in Arduino sketch.

Serial.begin() is used everywhere in Arduino sketches, but how does it work really?  My attempt to understand this process; written in embedded C and tested on an arduino Uno R3.
